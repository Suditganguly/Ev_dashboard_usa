Electric Vehicle Growth & Distribution Dashboard (Power BI)

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This project analyzes the growth and distribution of Electric Vehicles (EVs) across the USA (2023 dataset) using Power BI.
The rise of EVs highlights the shift toward sustainable transportation, but adoption varies widely across states, cities, and vehicle types.

The goal of this project is to transform raw EV registration data into actionable insights to better understand adoption patterns, infrastructure readiness, and market opportunities.

ðŸ”¹ Business Objectives

Stakeholders wanted answers to three key questions:

Which states, cities, and counties are leading in EV adoption?

What makes, models, and EV types dominate the US market?

How do factors like range, CAFV eligibility, and utility providers influence adoption trends?

ðŸ”¹ Dataset

Source: U.S. EV Registration Dataset (2023)

Time Period: 2023

Key Fields: State, County, City, Make, Model, EV Type, Model Year, Electric Range, CAFV Eligibility, Electric Utility

ðŸ”¹ Key Visuals & Insights

KPI Overview

Total EVs Registered: 235,692

Most Popular Make: Tesla (~43%)

Most Popular Model: Tesla Model Y (followed by Model 3)

Most Common EV Type: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs ~79%)

Growth Trend

EV adoption has accelerated sharply since 2018, peaking in recent years.

State & City Analysis

Washington State dominates EV registrations.

Top cities: Seattle, Bellevue, and Vancouver lead adoption.

CAFV Eligibility

Nearly 60% of EVs are CAFV-eligible, meaning they qualify for clean alternative fuel incentives.

Range Distribution

Most EVs fall between 200â€“300 miles of range, balancing cost and practicality.

Electric Utility Insights

Puget Sound Energy supports the largest share of EVs, followed by Seattle City Light and others.

Vehicle Type & Model Insights

BEVs dominate (187K vehicles), while Plug-in Hybrids make up the rest.

Tesla Model Y & Model 3 are market leaders; Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Bolt follow.

ðŸ”¹ Problems Identified (as a Data Analyst)

From the analysis, several key challenges became clear:

Geographic concentration â†’ EV adoption is heavily concentrated in Washington, leaving many states lagging behind.

Make & Model dominance â†’ Tesla dominates with ~43% market share, reducing competition and diversity.

Infrastructure dependency â†’ EV ownership is clustered around major utilities, creating pressure on energy distribution.

Range limitations â†’ A large share of vehicles fall within the 200â€“300 mile range, which may not suit long-distance needs.

ðŸ”¹ Recommendations

To address these challenges, I recommend the following actions:

Expand adoption beyond Washington â†’ Incentivize other states through tax credits, awareness campaigns, and charging infrastructure expansion.

Diversify the EV market â†’ Encourage adoption of non-Tesla brands by promoting affordability and variety.

Support utility providers â†’ Partner with utilities to scale charging infrastructure and grid capacity.

Enhance range innovation â†’ Encourage R&D for EVs exceeding 300+ miles to support rural and long-distance drivers.

ðŸ”¹ Business Impact

If these recommendations are implemented, potential outcomes include:

Balanced EV growth â†’ Reduce geographic imbalance and improve nationwide adoption.

Market competition â†’ Encourage more brands to grow, creating affordability and innovation.

Infrastructure resilience â†’ Avoid overloading select utilities and improve customer experience.

Long-distance adoption â†’ Wider appeal for EVs in rural and intercity travel markets.

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Techniques

Power BI Desktop â†’ Data visualization & dashboarding

SQL â†’ Data cleaning & transformation

DAX Measures â†’ KPIs like EV % by Make, Range Distribution

Geo-Mapping â†’ EV adoption by State, City, and County

ðŸ”¹ Final Takeaway

This dashboard provided a 360Â° view of EV adoption across the USA by showing:

What happened (growth in registrations, Tesla dominance, state & city concentration)

Why it happened (CAFV incentives, utility readiness, consumer preference for BEVs)

What could happen next (need for broader adoption, infrastructure scaling, and competition beyond Tesla)

As a data analyst, I identified concentration risks, range limitations, and market dominance issues â€” and recommended data-driven actions to ensure sustainable, inclusive, and balanced EV growth in the coming years.
